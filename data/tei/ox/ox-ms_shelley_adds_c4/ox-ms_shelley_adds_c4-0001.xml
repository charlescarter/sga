    <line rend="indent1">When Sir John Shelley-Rolls presented MS. Shelley adds. C. 4 to the Bodleian in 1946,</line>
    <line rend="indent1">it comprised a leather box and a series of 'folders' (foolscap bifolia of lined paper)</line>
    <line rend="indent1">which contained Shelley autograph sheets, still loose. The descriptions inscribed</line>
    <line rend="indent1">on the folders are in Sir John's hand. He numbered the folders 1-38, and also</line>
    <line rend="indent1">wrote in numbers in light pencil (sometimes not now legible) in the corners of the</line>
    <line rend="indent1">original leaves themselves. Folders 27, 28 and 31 encompass inner folders</line>
    <line rend="indent1">marked in Lady Shelley's hand (see also 29, unmarked). The handsome box,</line>
    <line rend="indent1">of light brown leather lined with dark red silk, was part of Lady Shelley's</line>
    <line rend="indent1">bequest to Sir John, for the table of contents inset into its inside lid (in the hand</line>
    <line rend="indent1">of an amanuensis of Lady Shelley) is ticked off item by item in pencil with</line>
    <line rend="indent1">Sir John's initials and dates in late January 1901; but this table does not</line>
    <line rend="indent1">correspond to the present contents.</line>
    <line rend="indent2">In Oct. 1985 - Feb. 1986 the loose sheets and folders were mounted into</line>
    <line rend="indent1">standard Bodleian fascicules, and the box was adapted by cutting its</line>
    <line rend="indent1">right-hand side at top and bottom to make a hinged flap.* The foliation</line>
    <line rend="indent1">of 1946 (in which Philip Long, an Assistant in the Dept. of Western Manuscripts,</line>
    <line rend="indent1">numbered original leaves and folders continuously and without distinction)</line>
    <line rend="indent1">has been retained and should be cited as such, although the necessities</line>
    <line rend="indent1">of mounting have dictated some changes of order. Fols. 141-177 and 210-2476 are now</line>
    <line rend="indent1">kept out of sequence at the bottom of the box.<space unit="chars" extent="5"/> B.C.B.-B 13 Feb. 1986 </line>

    <line>Readers are asked NOT to imitate the late Neville Rogers in writing announcements of their discoveries</line>
